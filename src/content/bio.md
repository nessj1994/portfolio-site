# About Me

From as early as I can remember, I’ve been passionate about computers, gaming, and solving problems. As a kid, I always said, “I want to make games someday.” That passion naturally led me to programming. I attended a vocational high school to start pursuing that dream and later earned a Bachelor's degree in Game Development from Full Sail University.

While I don't work directly in the games industry, I’ve still accomplished that childhood goal — I now work as a **Full Stack Software Engineer** with over six years of professional experience. In my spare time, I still dabble in game development through small side projects whenever I can.

I’m a lifelong learner, and over the course of my education and career, I’ve picked up a wide range of languages, frameworks, and tools. C++ will always have a special place in my heart, but in my day-to-day work, I'm usually deep in **React, TypeScript, and Python**.
