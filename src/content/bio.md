## About Me

I have over six years of professional experience as a developer. There is nothing more fulfilling to me than seeing my code bring ideas to life on a screen. I let that passion drive me forward in my pursuit to continually learn and improve as a software engineer.

Over the course of my education and professional career I have worked on apps for both the desktop and web. In my current role at Litania Sports Group I primarily work with **React**, **Typescript**, and **Python**. I am responsible for the development, deployment, and maintenance of both frontend applications and our custom **REST API**. Both our internal staff and dealer network use these tools in processes ranging from manufacturing our products to quoting custom gymnasiums for customers.

Though I work mostly on web based apps at my job, my love of coding started with game development in **C++** and **C#**. When I have spare time I like to dabble with game project ideas in **Unreal Engine** or **Unity** for fun.
